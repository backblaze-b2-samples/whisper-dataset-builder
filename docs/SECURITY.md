# Security

Security principles and implementation for whisper-dataset-builder.

## Trust Boundaries

- **Frontend -> API**: CORS-restricted to configured origins, scoped to `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE/OPTIONS`
- **API -> B2**: Authenticated via `B2_APPLICATION_KEY_ID` + `B2_APPLICATION_KEY`, signature v4
- **Client -> B2**: Presigned URLs for clip playback / download (short expiry)
- **Dataset deletes are prefix-scoped**: a delete only ever targets a single
  `datasets/<id>/` prefix (`repo/dataset_store.py::delete_prefix` refuses an
  empty/root prefix), so it can never wipe other data sharing the bucket.

## Upload Validation

- Filename sanitization: path traversal, null bytes, unsafe chars stripped
- MIME/extension consistency check against allowlist
- Chunked streaming with size enforcement (100MB default)
- Content-type allowlist (images, PDFs, text, archives, audio/video)
- Empty file rejection

## File Key Validation

- Empty keys rejected
- Path traversal patterns rejected (`../`, `%2e%2e`, backslashes, null bytes)
- The bucket is the only access boundary — add prefix scoping in
  `services/api/app/service/files.py::validate_key` if your deployment
  shares a bucket with other workloads

## Download Safety

- Presigned URLs force `Content-Disposition: attachment`
- Prevents inline rendering of user-uploaded content (XSS mitigation)

## Secrets Management

- All secrets loaded via environment variables (pydantic-settings)
- Never committed to source control
- `.env.example` documents required variables without values

## Agent Security Rules

- Never commit `.env`, credentials, or API keys
- Never weaken validation without explicit instruction
- Never bypass CORS, auth, or input sanitization
- Always validate at system boundaries
